# Welcome

It breaks my entire heart to say this, but Katie Maloney Schwartz Maloney is right about everything. Now, let’s not be outlandish. Katie has been wrong more than she’s been right, and she’s undoubtedly been mean more than she’s ever been anything in her life. Still, every single action she took in tonight’s episode was entirely justified and there was absolutely nothing wrong with her. I wouldn’t have gone so far as to call Raquel a Call Your Nephew Terrence while being filmed, but considering the absolute insanity that Raquel displayed, I’ll allow it. (Lala, on the other hand, can shut right the fuck up, calling Raquel a “pig” when she had no dog in this particular fight.)

As right as Katie is, Raquel is just as wrong. Possibly more wrong. Every scene she’s in, every question she asks, every fight she provokes is a sort of cringe that is so destabilizing it will give you a code brown right in your clean underpants. That’s the thing that has really struck me about Raquel this season; it’s how erratic she’s gotten. She’s like a slot machine that has guzzled a whole case of Monster energy drinks. You’re never going to get the same thing twice, and you can never figure out exactly what her intentions are. There are two things that Katie is the rightest about. The first is when she asks her, mid-confrontation, “What are you doing right now?” No one has the foggiest. The other is she tells her to “take your six personalities” somewhere else. So it’s not just us; Katie sees it too!
